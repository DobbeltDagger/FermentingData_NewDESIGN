Maps are representational objects. They are created to give a view of a geographical territory while at the same time they naturalize a certain way of looking at the world. Traditionally, maps model spatial organization of an area, which is then written onto a piece of paper following certain rules of cartographic representation. Today such processes are still about a map but they include a range of different practices from collecting and visualisation of data to interaction design and other forms of data modeling.

This event is dedicated to exploration of mapping as diverse processes of tracing affective relations between things, people, and other phenomena including environment. Introducing projects that draw their methods from art, design and data science, the invited speakers will present their different methods of mapping and their different subjects/objects. Here, attention is on the process and its representational vision that captures relations not just spatially but includes different formats and measuring techniques. 

This is a free event but registration is required [here](https://events.au.dk/fermentingdatasymposium/signup)
