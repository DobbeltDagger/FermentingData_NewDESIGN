summary: 'The invitation to ferment data is an invitation to play with data. It is an invitation to discover and invent data processing through practice of fermentation. Fermenting data is a practice of sensing and sense making and as such it is a practice of aesthetics, knowledge and sociality with each other humans and nonhumans, as makers and processors of data.'
