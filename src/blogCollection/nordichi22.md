**Curating/Fermenting Data: data workflows for semantic web applications** is a one-day workshop part of pre-conference activities during NordiCHI2022 in Aarhus. We invite human–computer interaction researchers, Linked Open Data (LOD) experts, curators, designers and cultural practitioners to explore applications of LOD for the creation of participatory datasets and to ferment with us. 

**The aim of the workshop** is to work with a collection of small unstructured data while engaging with questions of ethical data use in HCI design and working with data against a “colonial impulse”  (Dourish/Mainwaring 2012). Curating data methods open the possibility to keep data ‘lively’ through curation workflows while actively engaging with questions about the design and implementation of technical systems that can support varying levels of interaction with data and their traces. 

In the workshop we will combine data curation with speculative processes of fermenting data by working with raw (physical) materials alongside their digital data proxies to create a case study dataset following the structuring principles of the semantic web. Participants will have the opportunity to smell and taste the ferments which will serve the “raw” basis of the dataset work. We will collaboratively create a structured dataset from ‘raw’ and unstructured data and document this process in order to critically reflect on decisions made during our workflows, also speculating on its possible future use and the way such dataset might be (mis)managed. For this we will work with Wikidata, the largest open and publicly curated data platform, which offers a uniquely diverse, networked and social system for data processing - wherein open data from many different knowledge domains gets enmeshed - and possibilities for intersection and symbiosis exist even against the grain of the totalising impulse.
