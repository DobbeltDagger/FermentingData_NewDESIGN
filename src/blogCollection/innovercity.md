**Fermenting Data at Innovercity** is a half-day workshop which will bring together students from the Media Information and Design Department of Hochschule Hannover (HsH), alongside staff from the Open Science Lab (OSL) at TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology, to jointly prototype Linked Open Data models for Fermenting Data datasets. The session is facilitated by Magda Tyżlik-Carver (Aarhus University), Lukas Fuchsgruber (TU Berlin) and Lozana Rossenova (OSL, TIB). 

In the session, we will co-design a sample data model for datasets of curated Fermenting Data gathered during previous editions of the workshops. We will use a dedicated instance of Wikibase (the free and open source software tool for managing Linked Open Data, maintained by Wikimedia Germany) to experiment with the data model structure and prototype in a live LOD environment. 

Results from the workshop will be published on this blog and (re)used in future Fermenting Data workshops.
