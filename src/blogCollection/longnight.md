On June 17, 2023, the annual Long Night of Sciences (Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften) took place in Berlin. At the Technical University, in front of the libary, visitors could visit the Bacteria Bar, where the Edible Alchemy project served fermented lemonade and spreads. Lukas Fuchsgruber was also there to represent the Fermenting Data project and engage visitors in questions: how to digitally record and curate the knowledge around bacteria cultures. Materials - photographs, quotes and screenshots - from previous workshops were shared on a large screen as a conversation starter. Snippets from the conversations around the food and drinks that could be tasted, as well as on fermentation as cultural heritage were recorded on paper.
