summary: 'Data is a material with which artists have been working for some time. Few years ago I curated an exhibition entitled Corrupting Data where I curated five different works by five different artists. I was especially interested in how artists make use of data, how they manipulate and process data, and how these different artists employ failure and error to make work with data.'
