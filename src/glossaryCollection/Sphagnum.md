Sphagnum is a genus of approximately 380 accepted species of mosses, commonly known as "peat moss", although that term is also sometimes used for peat. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16 to 26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species.
