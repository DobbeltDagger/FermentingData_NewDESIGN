<b>relationship</b> is a state of being connected or associated. It is the way in which people, things or concepts are related: blood relation, kinship relation, interest affinity, having something in common, are all different examples of relations. Relationships are empirical and affective. They result from actions, decisions, feelings. They are cultural and natural; they are evocative, they are abstract, they are real.
