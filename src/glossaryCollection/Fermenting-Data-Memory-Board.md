<b>Fermenting Data RAM (Random Access Memory)</b> is a built structure which stores and displays data of different kinds. Random Access Memory is typically to be found in any computational device, and it is used to store working data, that is all data currently used by the computer to perform necessary tasks while the computer is on. For Fermenting Data we repurpose RAM as an archival process for the project. In this version the Fermenting Data RAM displays projectâ€™s current data (in physical and digital form) which was collected since October 2020 until now. Designed together with Jens Hyldegaard from Bureau Detours, Fermenting Data RAM is an active archival infrastructure for random access of Fermenting Data processes.
