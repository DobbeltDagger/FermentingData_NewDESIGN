Fermentation defines a metabolic process where, under specific conditions (in this case no oxygen) microbes create energy, alcohol and acid from sugar and starch. Some say that, in its most basic, fermentation is a controlled decay. Lynn Margulis, a scientist and a researcher of microbial forms, defined fermentation as a microbial invention, an unprecedented feat that humanity has not matched. Together with photosynthesis, oxygen breathing and removal of nitrogen from the air, fermentation is a miniature chemical system that has been part of the making of this planet.
