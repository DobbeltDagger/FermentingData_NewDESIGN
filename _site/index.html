    <!-- <h2>About Fermenting Data</h2> -->
    <p>Fermenting Data is a long-term curatorial project engaging in sensing and sense-making with data and fermentation. It is dedicated to reclaiming data as common practice rather than being assigned to statistics, machine learning, and other computational modelling methods. It is an invitation to discover and invent data processing through practice of fermentation. To ferment data is to speculate and create ways to live together as people and others who care.</p>

        <h2>Introducing Fermenting Data at PCD in Aarhus </h2>
        <p>In February I introduced Fermenting Data project during Processing Community Day which took place in DOKK1 in Aarhus. I was invited by the code&amp;share community to talk about this curatorial research project.</p>

        <h2>Corrupting Data</h2>
        <p>Data is a material with which artists have been working for some time. Few years ago I curated an exhibition entitled Corrupting Data where I curated five different works by five different artists. I was especially interested in how artists make use of data, how they manipulate and process data, and how these different artists employ failure and error to make work with data.</p>

        <h2>Why to Ferment Data?</h2>
        <p>The invitation to ferment data is an invitation to play with data. It is an invitation to discover and invent data processing through practice of fermentation. Fermenting data is a practice of sensing and sense making and as such it is a practice of aesthetics, knowledge and sociality with each other humans and nonhumans, as makers and processors of data.</p>
